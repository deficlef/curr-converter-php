	<label class='topic-header'><h3>Developing In A REST-Based Approach Compared to SOAP</h3></label>
    <h4>Advantages</h4>
	<p class='topic-body'>
REST makes the web service easy to use, more flexible and can be used by anyone who knows how to write a URL. With REST, you just pop the URL into the browser and see the data. REST takes fewer lines of code to do the same thing as SOAP and is closer to other Web technologies in design philosophy. With SOAP, the user would have had to deal with the "overhead" of the SOAP Envelope that accompanies the data. SOAP by default returns the response in XML, meaning that if used for this API, it won’t have been as easy to switch format to JSON. Where as using REST, we are able to return the API’s responses in XML or JSON by simply changing the format value, and even extend it to include more formats e.g. CSV and RSS, allowed in the REST architecture style.
	</p>
    <p class='topic-body'>
One major benefit of developing the API in a REST approach is that all a user needs to call and use it is a browser and a HTTP stack, which can be found in almost every device and machine. This makes the service easy to reach and use. However, developing with SOAP approach would provide a nicer data structure, but you need a full-fledged SOAP client to call the service as your web browser won't be sufficient.
    </p>
    <p class='topic-body'>
REST makes the development lightweight and can be implemented using almost any tool, leading to lower bandwidth and shorter learning curve. However, the clients have to know what to send and what to expect. Since we are building a simple service, it is sufficient to use a handful of nouns and verbs. However, if it was more complex, it would have been difficult to design around just nouns and four verbs. This is where a SOAP approach would have been more beneficial for architectural design.
    </p>
    <p class='topic-body'>
REST clients might take longer to build e.g. browser, but they are not tied to a specific service where as SOAP clients are e.g. a Feed Reader. This allows the possibility of combining RESTful services on a REST client; thereby providing more functionality e.g. having the currency API as an embedded widget on a browser, along with Yahoo and Facebook widgets. 
    </p>
    <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
    <p>
Some disadvantages of developing in a REST approach are
    <ul>
        <li>browsers only allow the use of two verbs i.e. GET and POST, and</li>
        <li>caching is constantly getting in the way</li>      
    </ul>
This prevented me from immediately seeing results of modifications to some resources, until I cleared the cache. However, since REST deals directly with resources on a server, using the DELETE, POST and PUT verbs would mean looking for a resource with a specified identity on the server to modify, which in the case of this API, would not exist as our resources are in an XML file.
    </p>
    <p> 
This then leads to designing the client application in a RESTful manner, RESTful in the sense that it modifies the identified XML node (resource) in the XML document, based on the chosen action (verb) in the form; using the POST HTTP request of the form. 
    </p>

	<label class='topic-header'><h3>Extensions and Improvements for the Application
</h3></label>
	<p class='topic-body'>
The application could be extended to return responses in more formats that are compliant with the REST architectural style e.g. CSV, JSON and HTML.
	</p>
    <p class='topic-body'>
It can also be re-designed to be an embeddable widget, allowing it to be added onto other websites and provide the currency service. This would mean re-designing the layout for small widget boxes and adding responsiveness in order to match widget sizes.
    </p>
    <p class='topic-body'>
A data validation layer could also be added on the front end of the client application, using JavaScript, to constrain what data passes through. This could help prevent and reduce unexpected errors from occurring in the API.
    </p>

	<label class='topic-header'><h3>Promote Re-Use in Application
</h3></label>
	<p class='topic-body'>
More currencies can be added to the XML database in order to expand the currency collection. Outdated currencies can be removed from the system to keep it clean and relevant. 
	</p>
    <p class='topic-body'>
As the application is programmed to update currency rates at a set interval, rates are always kept up to date, this thereby encourages re-use of the service. 
    </p>
    <p>
To increase precision, the update interval can be shortened so the currency rates are updated more frequently. Furthermore to prevent unnecessary updating, the API can be programmed to compare selected rates in the XML with their equivalents on the external API (Fixer.io), and if there is a difference, the XML currency document can then be updated.
